# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
I probably could have better awareness of where I spend time. I will dive into a task and loss awareness of how my day is spent. 
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
A function is like a little factory that takes things and produces/does things. 
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
Arugments are values that are passed to a function during invocation. These arguments are then matched and assigned to the parameters, based on their order and quantity. Parameters then serve as variables in the local scope of the function. 
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to bring to your Small Group?
I don't have specific questions about function declarations. One fun fact about functions in JS. 
1) They are first-class citizens, i.e. can be passed as values which enables functional programming.
